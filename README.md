HPPR MT Evaluation metric - referenceless metric - Quality Estimation of Machine Translation - Using syntactic structure

=========================

Trying to bridge the phrase level tag sets of multilingual treebanks, this paper designs a phrase mapping between the French Treebank and the English Penn Treebank. Furthermore, one of the potential applications of this mapping work is explored in the machine translation evaluation task. This novel evaluation model developed without using reference translations yields promising results as compared to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics.
