A Universal Phrase Tagset.  
=========================

This project contains mappings from language and Treebank specific phrase tagsets (phrase categories) to a set of 
refined universal phrase tags, as described in the published paper: 

“Phrase Tagset Mapping for French and English Treebanks and Its Application in Machine Translation Evaluation” by 
Aaron L.-F. Han, Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao, Liangye He, Shuo Li, and Ling Zhu. 2013. Proceedings of the 25th
international conference of the German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology, September 23rd-27th,
Darmstadt, Germany. LNCS Vol. 8105, pp. 119–131. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Currently, the phrase tagset mapping work and the open source code cover 16 treebanks and the following 15 languages:

Chinese, English, French, German, Czech, Spanish, Arabic, Korean, Danish, Estonian, Hungarian, Icelandic, 
Italian, Japanese, Swedish, …  

The phrase tagset mapping codes of other languages and treebanks will be uploaded soon. If you use the universal phrase
tagset or the phrase tagset mapping work in your research, please cite above paper. 

See this Appendix for: phrase tagset mapping table from language and Treebank specific phrase tagsets
(phrase categories) to the universal phrase tagset.

The universal phrase tagset and mapping works are refined after a lot of researches and experiments. However,
if you find any bug in the codes or unreasonable mapping in the table, please do not hesitate to contact us.
